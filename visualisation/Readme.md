		The following application is the interim result and important milestone of the NIKI 4.0 project.
		The app implements a mobile client for the visualization of airflow data gathered with industry 4.0 sensors and maintained in an OPC UA Server.
		The data visualization is supported by the ARToolkit framework. The airflow is represented with the help of augmented reality, 
		by virtual elements in form of arrows and prisms

		The ARToolKit framework has been used for the implementation of the visualization and more information is available here:
		https://www.artoolkit.org/

		The Prosys OPC UA Java SDK has been used for the development and implementation of the client and the connection to an OPC UA Server.
		More information about Prosys can be found under https://www.prosysopc.com/products/opc-ua-java-sdk/
