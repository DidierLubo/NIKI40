Medium priority
===============

Ongoing:
========
- code documentation can always be improved
- end-user documentation can always be improved

Low priority:
=============
- In sensor config, make objects a hierarchy level
  - will break sensor config format
  -> Do when the sensor config format changes for other reasons
- support more types:
  - time?
    - not yet needed
- optimize horizontal space of ScrollArea

Won't do:
=========
- Bug when sending an empty string
  - was intentional in CC13xx firmware design
- Bug: sometimes the UI hangs after errors
  - not encountered since a long time (with many changes since)
  -> consider already fixed until reproduced

Undecided:
==========
- When the deamon hangs in timeout-retry during sending values, should the
  value be re-calculated between retries?
- waveform for enums?
  - not yet needed
- Decouple one-to-one correspondence between mutable resources and UI
  resource lines?
  - not yet needed
  - will break sensor config format
- make compatible with Python 3?
  - pros:
    - we wouldn't need to mandate a Python version
  - cons:
    - potential breakage
    - may be a liability to maintain
- switch to Python 3?
  - pros:
    - Python 3 is nicer
  - cons:
    - potential breakage
